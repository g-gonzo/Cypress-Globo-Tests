# Cypress-Globo-Tests
This is my first attempt at Cypress testing using a mock website that I reused from a Plural Sight training video. This allowed me a somewhat functional website that could easily be transitioned to Cypress training.
## Motivation
Trying to learn the ins and outs of Cypress Automation Testing and reading articles, blogs and watching videos is just not enough. I definitely need some hands on coding experience. After recently finishing up a Plural Sight lesson I decided to try and add some Cypress tests to the mock website to learn some automation testing.
## Build status
Downloaded zip file from GitHub and followed instructions on the readme page.
## Code style
